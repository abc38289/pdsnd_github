### Description
This project is used to learn how to use Python, Numpy, and Pandas to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States.

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

###### #2 Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

###### #3 Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

###### #4 User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
